            <p>Memos in this course serve two purposes: (1) to practice a form of workplace literacy you may encounter in leadership or professional contexts, and (2) to create space to clarify issues or design choices in your assignments—including making a reasoned case when you disagree with feedback. This memo is formatted as an emailed memo per Purdue OWL conventions (date, subject, address information, etc.) and provides detailed answers to the four required questions.</p>

              <div><strong>TO:</strong> LMC 3403 Professor (Tech Communications)</div>
              <div><strong>FROM:</strong> Krish Sharma</div>
              <div><strong>DATE:</strong> September 25, 2025</div>
              <div><strong>SUBJECT:</strong> Professional Website Unit Memo</div>
            </div>

            <h3 class="h6 mt-3">Opening</h3>
            <p>This memo outlines my website’s audience and goals, the documents selected to represent my professional profile, how peer/instructor feedback informed revisions, and the main challenges I encountered and resolved during the unit.</p>

            <h3 class="h6 mt-3">1) Audience and Job Application Context</h3>
            <p>I am targeting early‑stage startups that value speed, ownership, and tangible outcomes. These teams look for candidates who can ship quickly, operate with agency, make pragmatic tradeoffs, and learn from real‑world feedback. They typically prize bias‑to‑action, customer focus, and the ability to communicate clearly under uncertainty. My website reflects these values by foregrounding shipped work, concise explanations, and live demos where available. I highlight measurable impact (e.g., hackathon wins, deployed features), keep copy direct and scannable, and provide clear calls‑to‑action, mirroring environments where velocity and accountability matter.</p>

            <h3 class="h6 mt-3">2) Documents Selected</h3>
            <p>I selected two of my winning hackathon projects. They demonstrate that I can perform in fast‑paced, high‑pressure scenarios and deliver functional solutions end‑to‑end. Together they show rapid execution, collaborative problem‑solving, and the ability to make principled decisions under tight constraints—qualities valued by startups. Each project page briefly explains the problem, my role, the approach, and outcomes to help evaluators quickly understand relevance.</p>

            <h3 class="h6 mt-3">3) Incorporation of Feedback</h3>
            <p>I edited my bio to fit the target word count while expanding on why I care and what I actually do. I improved clarity across multiple pages, tightening language and reorganizing content for readability. On the homepage, I added an additional image to highlight a LeetCode achievement as a concrete signal of problem‑solving ability. I also broke longer sections into smaller, more digestible blocks with headings to support scanning.</p>

            <h3 class="h6 mt-3">4) Challenges and Resolutions</h3>
            <p>The main challenge was achieving consistent styling and readability across devices. I built the site with a framework that was unfamiliar to me as a deliberate challenge, and I initially ran into layout and typography inconsistencies between computers. It took longer to resolve styling details, but I addressed them through iterative testing on different viewports, simplifying custom CSS, and leaning on the framework’s responsive grid and utility classes to ensure consistency.</p>

            <h3 class="h6 mt-3">Closing</h3>
            <p>Thank you for reviewing my submission. I’m happy to discuss specific design choices, tradeoffs, or additional revisions that would improve clarity, tone, or alignment with professional communication standards.</p>
